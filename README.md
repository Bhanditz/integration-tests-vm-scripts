How to wrap TeamCity NUnit Runner with powershell?

Here is the example.

You may try Platform\build\TestProduct\Impl\InTest\RunTests.ps1

- locally and nunit-console will be used
- at TeamCity and TeamCity runner will be used

When your build scripts are relativelly complicated, the ability to run the whole thing locally became very desirable.

My plan of what to share next is [here](dev-in-test.blogspot.com/2014/02/how-we-at-jetbrains-dotnet-team-do.html).
